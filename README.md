# IL181: Impact Evaluation

This contains the final assignment for my Impact Evaluation (IL181) senior tutorial at Minerva Schools at KGI, Fall 2020. It was a prototype of the impact evaluation done in my [Capstone Project](https://github.com/giovannachaves/Capstone-Project), using a different dataset (PNADc) and a genetic matching algorithm instead of a difference-in-differences.
